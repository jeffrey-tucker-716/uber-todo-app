I know this is like a silent movie, but the essentials are here.

Make a new class library that deals with data access alone.  Use the class library dot net core template.
I have a database first design because it helps me deal with the database modeling in a separate tool like SSMS or some relational modeller.
The database I have is called Todo.

Set the class library as default for the solution (for now).  
Open the nuget package manager.
Install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (3.1.3 latest)
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (3.1.3 latest)

Open the Package Manager Console; set the Default Project to the name of your class library.

Issue the command Scaffold-DbContext "Server=.;Database=Todo;Trusted_Connection=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models

You should get something like this:

PM> Scaffold-DbContext "Server=.;Database=Todo;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models
Build started...
Build succeeded.
